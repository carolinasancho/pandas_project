<p align="center"> Second Python Project in Ironhack Bootcamp :star:
</h1>

In this exercise we worked with a Global Shark Attack File dataset as found in the Kaggle webpage. The job was applying different cleaning and manipulation techniques in this dataset, with significantly messy data. This will allow us to perform an analysis of the shark attack. With the cleaned dataset, the objective is to answer a 'business question': something we wanted to know about shark attacks and try to answer that using data.This focused
our cleaning and data manipulation through the process.

In my job I tryed to figure out the months with more shark attacks in each country and activity, also including sex and age.

## ðŸ›  Data Cleaning:

As downloaded from the Kaggle site, this dataset was very messy, but  I conducted this with a diverse set of tools in Python. I focused the cleaning in my goal, which was only the columns and rows that would contribute to my answer.

I identified columns without information, corrected texts and obtained data from columns to create others. I had to filter the Date column in order to obtain the months and after that I could start my analysis.

##  ðŸ’» Aggregation and Analysis:

With an cleaned dataset, I started grouping some information in order to find the best dataframe configuration to answer my question. Founded the conclusion that months in summer have more shark attack in USA and AUSTRALIA, I also concluded that people who most suffer these attacks are man who practice surfing with approximately 30 years. 

Considering the very limited time to perform analysis on this dataset and the analysis techniques that I know at the moment, with some effort I could obtain my results.
